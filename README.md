# Frontend Developer Test Task: Мир Кораблей

This project is a **React-based web application** that displays a list of ships from the game "Мир Кораблей" (World of Warships). Users can view ship details (name, class, nation, level, description, and image) and filter ships by **level**, **nation**, **class**, and **name**. The application fetches data using a **GraphQL API** and is built with **Vite** as the bundler.
